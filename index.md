**In what ways were British art and culture political in the Nineteenth Century?**

With the nineteenth century being a viable turning point within English society, the dawn of the industrial revolution pivoted not only technology within the time but also art and culture. The Nineteenth Century was a time of change and uproar in copious ways, studies of the time depicting unique momentous change within the century.

These changes stemming from social unrest were inherently political, with countless uprisings throughout England at the time, protests leaked from every inch of society. These changes however were not the creation of purely physical uprisings from labourers but art and culture of the middle and upper class society took hits as well. The Arts became a politically charged area ensuring their views on the new found changes were heard and their support of the uprisings accepted. With new genres of artists arising throughout the century, awareness and support were gained causing unity across the country regardless of classes, significant change being achieved through uprisings and protests both physical and visual.

The dawn of the Romantic Artists created a newfound political awareness within the art community and upper class culture of the nineteenth century, art had never been so politically charged. The romantics created a stark contrast between their ideology and art compared to the past neoclassism era. Romatacism within art has been defined by art historian *Kathryn Calley Galitz* as a response to the disillusionment with the Enlightenment values of reason and order in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789, its overall characteristic was a new emotionalism in contrast to the prevailing ideas of classical restraint. She refers to it {Romanticism} as *first defined as an aesthetic in literary criticism around 1800, gained momentum as an artistic movement in France and Britain in the early decades of the nineteenth century and flourished until mid-century. With its emphasis on the imagination and emotion, Romanticism emerged as a response to the disillusionment with the Enlightenment values of reason and order in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789.'* This newfound aesthetic already olitically charged with its creaion contrasts with previous era of neoclassism; an era defined as a *reflection of desire to rekindle the spirit and forms of classical art from ancient Greece and Rome, whose principles of order and reason were entirely in keeping with the European Age of Enlightenment.* Neoclassism portrayed beautiful, realistic classical homages to history that only the rich and educated could perceive and understand, wheras this new era of realism ensured messages were strongly stated and the homage was paid to nature against the demonic feat of industrialism. 

Through this newfound era within art at such a tumultuous time there was no dount that their response to disillusionment would be politically charged, these artists protested through beautiful depictions of classical landscapes as a support for the olights and uprsings throughout the country,they depicted english lanscapes as sullied by industrialisation bringing forth visual depictions of what they believed was the cause of so much tension.These romanticised creations were a homage to the preindustrial state of the UK,John Constables 'The Hay Wain' an oilpainting depicting a scenic landscape in the countryside mard with dark clouds, critics believing it as a depition of the nearing darkness of the industrial age, whilst Constable had usually produced lanscapes he was usually met with contempt until the nineteenth century were they used as political tools by Conservative rurals to provide proof of the damage they believed would be caused by industrialisation. However these subtle pieces of beautiful romantcised landscape wasnt the oly form of political art during the time, many artists produced starkly obvious apposing pieces that were a with  but also some pieces were marred with tragedies as seen by (picture of fire town), these pieces showed what the artists believed would be the fate of England if the industrial revolution was not resolved, depictions of vicious fires and towns burning encompassed society as a stark warning and support for the uprisings, these once favoured peaceful luxurious pieces had become marred with politics and bought this plight to the upper classes. 


In British art, Romanticism was embraced in new responses to nature in the art of John Constable and J.M.W. Turner. Visionary artist William Blake examined manâ€™s place in the cosmos and his relationship to God as well as exploring new ways of looking at human history. Other significant painters of history subjects were Henry Fuseli, James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer
